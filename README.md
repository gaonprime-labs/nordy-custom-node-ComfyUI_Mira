| Inputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Width`  `Height` | Image size, could be difference with cavan size, but recommended to connect them together. |
| `Colum_first` | A boolean trigger, when enabled, will treat default cut as a horizontal cut. |
| `Rows`  `Colums` |  Define how many `Blocks` you want, all `Blocks` are the same weight. (Blocks = Rows x Colums) <br />  ***Low prority, only works when Layout is incorrect.*** |
| `Layout` | Customized `Blocks` with layouts input. e.g. `1,2,1,1;2,4,6`<br /> `0-9` `,` `;` Check Examples section for more detail. <br />***High prority, in case you don't need custom layout, simply put `#` here.*** |

Random Tilling Layouts    
Random Tilling Mask `Layout` Generator for `Create Tilling PNG Mask -> Layout`   

**Highly recommend connect the output `layout` or `Create PNG Mask -> Debug` to `ShowText` node.**   
Refer to [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts)   

**Known Issue** about `Seed Generator`   
Switching `randomize` to `fixed` now works immediately.   
But, switching `fixed` to `randomize`, it need 2 times `Queue Prompt` to take affect. (Because of the ComfyUI logic)   
      
Solution: Try `Global Seed (Inspire)` from [ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack)   

**Reminder**   
The `rnd_seed` have nothing to do with the actual random numbers, you can't get the same `layout` with the same `rnd_seed`, it is recommended to use `ShowText` and `Notes` to save your favourite `layout`.   

**Hint**   
Set rows or colums to `0` for only one direction cuts. Whichever is set to `0` will automatically cut according to the other non-zero setting. Just in case all fours are `0`, it will return `1,1`.   
    
| Inputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `min_rows` `max_rows` | Range of how many `N cuts` you may want, set both to 0 to disable it. |
| `min_colums` `max_colums` | Range of how many `G cuts` you may want, set both to 0 to disable it. |
| `max_weights_gcuts` | The maxium weight of `G cuts` range from 1 to `max_weights_gcuts` |
| `max_weights_ncuts` | The maxium weight of `N cuts` range from 1 to `max_weights_ncuts` | 
| `rnd_seed`| Connect to the `Seed Generator` node, then use `Global Seed (Inspire)` node to control it properly. |
    
| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Layout` | Layouts string, you need connect it to `Create PNG Mask -> layout` |

| `min_nested`, `max_nested` | Range of nest you want. |
| `min_weights`, `max_weights` | The weight of every nest. |
| `rnd_seed` | Connect to the `Seed Generator` node, then use `Global Seed (Inspire)` node to control it properly. |
            
| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Layout` | Layouts string, you need connect it to `Create Nested PNG Mask -> layout` |
| `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` | Random Boolean for `Create Nested PNG Mask -> Layout` |

Upscale Image By Model Then Resize     

This is an experimental feature for zooming in an image on a model and then zooming out to a specified size (a multiple of 8 in length and width).     

For example, if the input model zooms the image 4x by default and the node is set to zoom 2x, then the image will first be zoomed 4x using the model and then resized to 2x.    
    
| Inputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `upscale_model` | Model for upscaling |
| `image` | Source Image |
| `resize_scale` | Real resize ratio, the result will be the nearest multiple of `8` |

| `Odd` | `True` |

None To Zero    
Check if the `check_none` is None, then set return value to `0`.   

This is a `spoofing Node` to `mess up` with `other Nodes`. Imaging everyothers could follow this rule to create their `Custom Node`, the `ComfyUI` could be more `Logic`.   
***The extra logic calls do add a bit of system overhead, but it's Python, so who cares?***   

| Inputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `check_none` | `None` or `NOT None` from `74 family` |
| `ret_float` | The `float` result when `NOT None`  |
| `ret_int` | The `intenger` result when `NOT None` |

| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ret_float` | `AS IS` when `NOT None`, and `0` when `None`  |
| `ret_int` | `AS IS` when `NOT None`, and `0` when `None`  |
| `ret_image` | `AS IS` when `NOT None`, and `2x2 img` when `None`  |
| `none_image` | `AS IS` when `NOT None`, and `None` when `None`  |

------
Even or Odd List   
Checks whether each `digit` (decimal) of the input `integer` is odd or even, and returns `true` for even numbers and `false` for odd numbers.    
The final output is a `Boolean List` which is connected to the `Boolean List Interpreter`.    
If the input `Number of digits` is less than the `Requirement`, it will go back to the lowest digit to re-recognize and complete the list,    
and the way the list is completed can be chosen as `as is` or `not`.    
The output node `String` displays the actual results.   

| Inputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `integer` | Recommend connect to `Seed Generator` |
| `quantity` | Length of the `Boolean list`, if `quantity` is greater than `len(str(integer))`, will trigger `filling` for extra bits.|
| `NOT_filling` | Filling algorithm, `Enable` for switch between `NOT` and `AS IS` in future loop, `Disable` for `AS IS` in every loop. |

| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bool_list` | Boolean list |
| `result` | String result |

### LoRA
LoRA Loader With Name Stacker    

A simple LoRA loader with name stacker for any website that could not identify all LoRAs' information from image.   
Apparently that only happens with ComfyUI...    

| Inputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `model`  | Your Model node, the `purple` one. |
| `clip`  | Your Clip node, the `lemon yellow` one. |
| `lora_name`  | Selected LoRA. |
| `strength_model`  | LoRA strength for Model. |
| `strength_clip`  |  LoRA strength for Clip. |
| `bypass`  | Bypass current LoRA. |

| Optional Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `lora_stack`  | A `STRING` array from previous `LoRA Loader With Name Stacker`.  |

***Reminder: leave the locomotive(first one) empty.***

| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `MODEL`  | Model |
| `CLIP`  | CLIP |
| `lora_stack`  | New `STRING` array with current LoRA name and strength information. AS is when `bypass` is `Enable` or `strengths` are all `0`. |

***Reminder: For the 2nd Hires fix, the same LoRA name will be ignored.*** 

LoRA from Text

This is a blend node that extracts and blends the LoRA information you enter in webui format into the model, as well as the clip.    

Format support:
```
<lora:loraname>
<lora:loraname:model str>
<lora:loraname:model str:clip str>
<lora:loraname:model str:clip str:hires model str:hires clip str>

To bypass current LoRA in 1st or 2nd stage, set model and clip str both to 0.  
<lora:loraname:0:0:1:1>     Only works in 2nd
<lora:loraname:1:1:0:0>     Only works in 1st
<lora:loraname:0:0:0:0>     Works, but WHY??? Just delete it.
```

Prompt Example:    
```
solo, masterpiece, best quality, amazing quality,
